# What's new in WebdriverIO v4?

The history has proven us: no major version change without rewriting the whole code base. This time we have rewritten everything into ES2016 conform JavaScript and we use Babel now to compile the code before pushing it to NPM. This allows us not only to specify a project wide code style using ESLint, it also sets an important milestone for the future development of WebdriverIO.
